# Food Item Recognition and Calorie Estimation

This repository contains the implementation of a machine learning model for recognizing food items from images and estimating their calorie content. The model assists users in tracking their dietary intake and making informed food choices.

## Model Overview

- **Objective**: To recognize food items from images and estimate their calorie content.
- **Dataset**: A diverse set of food images annotated with labels and calorie information.
- **Algorithm Used**: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with Transfer Learning.
- **Features Used**: Image data of various food items.

## Files in the Repository

- **food_recognition_model.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook containing the Python code for training and evaluating the food recognition and calorie estimation model.
- **dataset/**: Directory containing the dataset of food images, from kaggle
- **requirements.txt**: List of required Python packages for running the model(in the README file)
- **README.md**: This file, providing an overview of the repository and instructions for running the code.

## Instructions for Use

### Clone the Repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/username/food-recognition-calorie-estimation.git
```

### Install Dependencies

Ensure you have the required Python packages installed. You can install them using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Run the Notebook

Open and run the `food_recognition_model.ipynb` notebook in Jupyter or any compatible environment. Follow the instructions provided in the notebook to train the model, visualize the results, and interpret the food item recognition and calorie estimation.

### Predicting with the Model

To use the trained model for predicting food items and estimating calories, run:

```bash
python predict.py --image_path path_to_your_image
```

## Results

- The model successfully recognizes various food items from images and estimates their calorie content.
- Visualizations and metrics are provided to understand the model's performance and accuracy.

## Further Improvements

- Expand the dataset to include more diverse food items to improve model generalization.
- Experiment with different model architectures and hyperparameters to enhance performance.
- Develop a mobile application for easy dietary tracking on-the-go.
- Provide detailed nutritional information beyond calorie estimation.
